# zeanHooks
EquiHooks is a set of smart contract hooks designed to tackle Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), preventing various forms of exploitative transaction behaviors like front-running, back-running, sandwich attacks, Just-In-Time (JIT) trading, and more. By integrating these hooks into decentralized applications (dApps), users can experience a fairer, more secure transaction environment without the risk of malicious actors manipulating transaction order for profit.

# Core Features:
### Front-Running Protection:

- Prevents attackers from placing their own transaction in front of a user’s transaction to exploit price movements before the user’s order is processed.

- Template Strategy: Implement Commit-Reveal Schemes where users commit to a transaction in advance, revealing it only when the time is right.

### Back-Running Protection:

- Stops miners or validators from placing transactions after a user’s transaction to profit from the price changes caused by the user's transaction.

- Template Strategy: Delay the finalization of transaction outcomes to prevent immediate exploitation by any parties.
 ### Sandwich Attack Prevention:

- Guards against the strategy where an attacker places two orders—one before and one after a user’s transaction—to manipulate prices and profit from the user’s trade.

- Template Strategy: Fair Transaction Ordering ensures that transactions are executed in the order they were submitted to the network, without any reordering by miners.

### Just-In-Time (JIT) Trade Protection:

- Mitigates the risks associated with JIT trading, where a miner or validator can observe pending transactions and execute their own to capitalize on upcoming price movements.

- Template Strategy: Introduce transaction delay buffers and randomization, ensuring that all transactions are processed with a time delay that prevents market manipulation.

### Transaction Privacy Enhancement:

- Masks the content and details of transactions from miners until they are finalized, reducing the ability of malicious actors to manipulate transactions based on insider knowledge.

- Template Strategy: Private Transaction Channels for sensitive transactions, where the content is only visible to miners at the point of execution.

###  Dynamic Gas Fee Adjustment:

- Implements smart gas fee structures that prevent gas wars and ensure a fair transaction cost for everyone, preventing attackers from prioritizing their own trades by outbidding others.

- Template Strategy: Gas Cap Mechanism that adjusts transaction fees dynamically, ensuring users don't get outbid by miners.

  ### Fair Gas Utilization:

- Ensures that all transactions are executed efficiently and with minimal waste, maximizing the network’s capacity and improving user experience.

- Template Strategy: Optimized Gas Strategies that allow transactions to be processed based on fair pricing without overpaying for faster execution.

# Benefits of zeanHooks:
- Fairer Execution for Users: By preventing malicious actors from exploiting transaction ordering, users can rely on a system that executes trades fairly.

- Increased Security: EquiHooks ensures that trades are protected from manipulation, safeguarding assets and reducing the likelihood of losing funds to MEV strategies.

- Improved Market Integrity: By protecting users from MEV, EquiHooks helps maintain the integrity of the decentralized financial ecosystem.

- Optimized User Experience: Through strategies like delayed execution, commit-reveal, and gas fee fairness, users can interact with blockchain systems without worrying about backdoor strategies or market manipulation.

By integrating zeanHooks, decentralized applications can provide a user-first experience, ensuring that every transaction is processed fairly and securely without being subject to MEV exploitation.
